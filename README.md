The '''Ender Dragon''' is a [[hostile]] boss [[Mobs|mob]] that appears in [[the End]] dimension and is the final boss of the original ''Minecraft''. The Ender Dragon is a large dragon that breathes fire, spits fireballs, and is able to fly with great ease and maneuverability.

==Overview==
Since Beta 1.9 pre-release 6, a single Ender Dragon appears in each world's End dimension and can be fought and killed. It spawns on any [[difficulty]]; however, in Peaceful mode, it still fires damaging fireballs but its body does no damage. The Ender Dragon swoops at a [[player]], destroying any [[blocks]] she passes through, except [[obsidian]], indestructible blocks (such as [[bedrock]]), [[iron bars]], and [[End Stone|End stone]]. Once an Ender Dragon is killed, an [[End Gateway|End gateway]] appears within the vicinity. The [[Exit portal]] will also open, with a [[Dragon Egg]] on top. The End gateway leads to the "Outer End". Upon defeat, the Ender Dragon explodes and drops around 12,000 [[Experience Points|experience]] orbs (which take a player with no experience to around level 78), Entering the Exit portal will play the End Poem and the Minecraft credits, and afterward, the player will be sent back to their last saved spawn point. When one [[Ender Crystal]] is placed on each edge of the Exit Portal &ndash; for a total of 4 &ndash; the Dragon will respawn. However, when defeated, she will drop less experience than before (500 XP orbs) and will not summon another dragon egg when slain.

Every completed dragon fight also creates an End gateway portal floating within 75-100 blocks of the exit portal &ndash; up to 20 gateway portals can be generated.

==Appearance==
The Ender Dragon is a large, black dragon with glowing purple eyes. She is the largest implemented mob in the game. Only the unimplemented [[giant]] is larger. She has a few dark gray features, such as the wings, and various other parts of her body. Similar to the eyes of [[Enderman|Endermen]] and [[spider]]s, the Ender Dragon's eyes are visible through darkness, so a player will be able to see her coming through the dark sky of the End.

==Behavior==
Ender Dragons attack by charging at a player's lower waist, with their wings tucked in and diving downward. If hit with anything while swooping towards a player, even a fist, she will turn around and fly away. If anything besides end stone (various types, too), bedrock, iron bars, and obsidian touches her, she will break through. End Crystals that sit on top of the obsidian towers will heal her. The Ender Dragon flies around the sky and shoots purple fire charges (Ender acid). This Ender acid, unlike a [[ghast]] fireball, can't be deflected. After a while, she will go down and hover above the inactive End portal while constantly spraying Ender acid out of her mouth, similar to how a dragon breathes fire when attacking.

==Strategy==
The 5X5 obsidian platform spawn point may not be directly connected to the center island of the End. As such, a bridge may need to be built. It's a good idea to bring scaffolding blocks to the End, particularly ones the Ender Dragon cannot destroy (e.g., obsidian and iron bars), so a player can access the main island. The alternative is to bring [[Ender Pearl|Ender pearls]].

Once they have entered the End, it is crucial to destroy as many of the Ender Crystals as possible before going after the boss, preferably with a bow or snowballs, although it will be necessary to climb some of the towers to break iron bars around some of the crystals. However, climbing the obsidian towers can be extremely dangerous, as there is a high chance of falling off and dying, and even if a player does not fall off, the Ender Dragon will likely knock a player off anyway. A way to mitigate the damage from this is to have boots with a high [[Enchantments#Feather Falling (Boots Only)|Feather Falling]] enchantment, or a bucket of water you can place under you to negate any fall damage. Using an Ender Pearl on the ground below is also a good way of mitigating fall damage, though it will still deal moderate damage to the player.

Due to the way iron bars connect to blocks around them, it is possible to shoot an arrow through the bottom of the iron bars in order to hit the crystal within. Provided the tower is low enough this method can completely remove the danger of climbing the towers. However it should be noted lining up the shot can take a considerable amount of time and focus depending on a player's skill, which could leave them open to attacks from the Ender Dragon.

Afterward, a player must defeat the actual Ender Dragon. A skilled archer with a powerful bow can deal a lot of damage to the dragon. However, when the dragon is perched on the exit portal, it becomes necessary to use a sword, as she is immune to arrows at this time. Critical hits are a great way to utilize a sword. Standing under the Ender Dragon's head will allow a player to strike her while encountering a minimal risk of injury or death from the Dragon's breath.

You can also utilize beds, as they explode similar to TNT if you try to use them in the End. All you must do is dig a 1-block deep hole, wait for the Ender Dragon to dive at you and blow up the bed when it is within range.

Take anything to the End that could be possibly needed. The worst thing about the End is the potential to run out of resources and get stuck, (This includes food, you want to be able to replenish health at any possible chance) as a player will not be able to return to the Overworld alive unless they manage to defeat the Ender Dragon.

Wear a [[Carved Pumpkin|carved pumpkin]] so Endermen won't attack, but beware that this reduces how much armor a player can have and severely impairs vision. Pay attention to the Endermen as well as Ender Dragon. The Endermen are just as likely to kill a player as the Ender Dragon if a pumpkin isn't being worn. Never stay in one place. If timing movements accordingly, it is very hard for the Ender Dragon to score a hit. Have enchanted weapons and armor. Enchanted bows and swords cause significantly more damage to Endermen and the Ender Dragon, while enchanted armor offers more protection from damage.

If possible, fight the Dragon as a group. Attempts to kill the Ender Dragon with just one person are considerably more difficult. Hitting the head of the Dragon deals the full damage of the weapon; hitting her anywhere else deals a quarter of the regular damage.

Always keep an eye on Endermen, as if enough are provoked, they may prove even larger of a threat than the Dragon herself. Look up as much as possible to limit attention received by Endermen if not wearing a pumpkin.
